# Deckbuilder 

## About

The deckbuilder was an opportunity to understand how a database and a server work together. The database was pretty simple (one table `card`) but it has a good number of columns to create a datamapper with different requests. 

It was enough to build some controllers and manage how to display the wanted data in the right routes. 

The use of session was a good introduction to handle the storage of the users interactions and informations.
